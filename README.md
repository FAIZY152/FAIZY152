### 🧠 Summary

I’ve spent the last 3+ years working as a full-stack developer with the MERN stack, Next.js and Laravel where I built and 
deployed real-world monolithic and microservices-based applications. Later completed a remote, self-paced internship at 
Mentoga, working on practical, industry-level projects. Built AI SaaS platforms, e-commerce apps, and dashboards using 
modern tools like GraphQL, Redis, RabbitMQ and OpenAI APIs. Gained hands-on experience in Docker, testing, API 
integration, authentication, and responsive design.

    performance for enterprise healthcare clients.**   
- **Built a Unified Payment System supporting 5 SaaS products under a shared billing infrastructure using Stripe 
   subscriptions and usage-based billing.**
- **Integrated GraphQL, OpenAI APIs, Redis, and Kafka into scalable systems 
- Dockerized microservices and ensured smooth production deployment
