### 🧠 Summary

I'm a passionate Full-Stack Developer with hands-on experience in building scalable web and mobile applications using the MERN stack, Next.js, and React Native. I have strong knowledge of both SQL and NoSQL databases, real-time tools like Socket.io, Redis, and Kafka, and experience working with Docker, GraphQL, Prisma, and microservices.

🚀 During my internship at the **UK Institute of IT** in Peshawar, I worked on real-world projects—contributing to both monolithic and microservices-based systems, writing test cases, and integrating OpenAI APIs.  
✨ I’ve also built and deployed my major projects:  
- **AI SaaS Platform**  
- **Food Ordering Plateform**
- **Build upto 5 Backend Services and Integrate it in Frontend**  
Both built using modern tools and best practices.
